  <h1> Recommended sales & marketing tools </h1>
  <p> Here's a list of tools that I use frequently when working on startup growth:</p>
  <h2>Content marketing & optimization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://www.clearscope.io/">Clearscope</a></h3>
      <p>Reverse engineer top performing content to discover winning content strategies that will grow your audience and search traffic.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Competitive analysis & research</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://www.kisstrends.com/">KissTrends</a></h3>
      <p>Analyze subreddits based on engagement and trends.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">BuzzSumo</a></h3>
      <p>Analyze content marketing based on social metrics. Other people's content that has already performed well provides insights.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a></h3>
      <p>See how topics, brands, products, and industries are trending over time.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://similarweb.com/">SimilarWeb</a></h3>
      <p>Look at how your competitors are doing on the web. Lots of interesting data to see including # of unique sessions, top traffic channels, web traffic by geo, etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a></h3>
      <p>View the evolution of how a website looked and functioned. Learn how established companies messaged their product or service and where design trends are moving.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="http://www.whois.com/whois">Whois</a></h3>
      <p>Get contact information for website owners from domain registration information. Sometimes unreliable because domains can be made private.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Search engine optimization (SEO)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">Advanced search operators (eg. site:, date:)</a></h3>
      <p>Perform queries that can show you how many pages a website has indexed ("site:"), the last time Google cached your page ("cache:"), and other goodies. Useful for learning how frequently Google crawls certain pages, how many of your pages Google has decided to index, and other things.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner">Keyword Planner</a></h3>
      <p>Keyword monthly search volume data provided by Google. Data accuracy is questionable when comparing the data between Google Search Console and/or Adwords paid campaigns.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://keywordtool.io/">Keyword Tool</a></h3>
      <p>Find a list of all the Google autocomplete phrases for keywords. An excellent way to discover how people are searching for things related keywords.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Sales</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://connect.clearbit.com/">Clearbit Connect</a></h3>
      <p>Find business email addresses given a company name. Somewhat reliable -- data feels out-of-date and sparse at times.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://neverbounce.com/">Neverbounce</a> & <a href="https://www.briteverify.com/">BriteVerify</a></h3>
      <p>Stop hard bounces with email list verification and list cleaning. Preventing hard bounces is necessary to keep your email deliverability and reputation in good standing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://contactout.com/">ContactOut</a></h3>
      <p>Reliably find anyone's personal email address given a LinkedIn profile.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/">Pipedrive</a></h3>
      <p>Trello-like CRM with lots of integrations. A little old-school feeling but robust in functionality.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="https://reply.io/">Reply</a></h3>
      <p>Outreach email automation sequencer. Plug in a bunch of emails and easily sequence out touches by date and variation.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
