title: "How to think about yoga cues with prana and apana verbs"

## Be as specific and simple as possible

Be able to speak to the pairs of opposites:

* “lean forward” AND “ground your inner heels”
* “arms up” AND “shoulders down” or “ground feet firmly”

Work towards using rights and lefts:

* “step your left leg forward” instead of “step the other leg forward”
* “engage your right leg” instead of “engage your back leg”

You can use landmarks of the room (front of the room, back) but don’t do it too much.

### There’s a big difference between cueing what vs how.

Use the how cue to augment the what cue, and sometimes the why cue.

#### WHAT you are doing

> “externally rotate your right thigh”

#### HOW do you do it 

> “lift your chest”

#### WHY you do it (sometimes)

> “the change in gravity helps the bowels move freely which aids digestion”

## Good pose starting verbs:

### Prana

* extend, reach
* lengthen
* firm, engage          (the core)
* strengthen, fire up         (the core)
* pull
* push
* draw
* sweep             (the foot to the sky)
* float             (the foot off the ground)
* lift            (the chest up and back)
* get taller
* bring
* pull back, draw back
* raise, elevate          (the heart up)

### Apana

* round
* ground, root
* relax, soft/en
* widen           (the shoulder blades)
* hinge             (from the hips)
* un/tuck           (the toes)
* hollow out          (the armpits)
* broaden           (the back)
* rotate, turn, spin        (the left heel to the floor)
* balance, distribute         (the weight evenly between your feet)
* sink deeper

## Stay away from:

* front / back (unless referring to the room)
* “microbend” -> say “draw your heels towards one another” instead
* “square your hips”
